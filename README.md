# Briefcase Project Creator App

The **Briefcase Project Creator** is a user-friendly application designed to streamline the creation of new Briefcase projects with a graphical interface. It simplifies the process of setting up project directories, configuring project details, and initializing projects using the Briefcase tool.

## Features

- **Directory Selection:** Allows users to choose a directory where the project will be created.
- **Project Configuration:** Users can input project-specific information such as:
  - Formal Name
  - App Name
  - Bundle Identifier
  - Project Description
  - Author's Name
  - Author's Email
  - Application URL
  - Project Name
- **License Selection:** Provides a dropdown to select the project license from popular options like BSD, MIT, Apache, GPL, and others.
- **GUI Framework Selection:** Users can choose the desired GUI framework, including Toga, PySide6, Pygame, Console, or None.
- **Project Creation:** Initiates the creation of a Briefcase project, including setting up a virtual environment and installing the necessary dependencies.

## Technical Details

The application is built using the Toga GUI toolkit and leverages Python's `asyncio` for asynchronous operations. It performs the following steps during project creation:

1. **Directory Selection:** Prompts the user to select a directory.
2. **Virtual Environment Creation:** Sets up a Python virtual environment in the selected directory.
3. **Dependency Installation:** Installs Briefcase in the virtual environment.
4. **Project Initialization:** Runs the `briefcase new` command, providing user inputs for project configuration.

### Error Handling

The app includes robust error handling to ensure users are informed of any issues during the project setup process, such as:

- Directory selection errors
- Python installation check failures
- Virtual environment creation errors
- Project initialization errors

### User Interface

The main window contains:

- Labels and text inputs for project configuration.
- Dropdown menus for license and GUI framework selection.
- A button to initiate project creation.
- A text area to display command output and status messages.

### Example Usage

```python
def main():
    return BriefcaseApp()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main().main_loop()
```

With the **Briefcase Project Creator**, developers can easily set up new projects with the necessary configurations and dependencies, all through an intuitive graphical interface.
